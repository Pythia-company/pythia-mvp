            <h2>1. What is Pythia:</h2>
            <div>
                Pythia is a dApp on Polygon and the Kovan testnet  that allows users
                to create markets and bet on their outcomes anonymously. Correct predictions
                are automatically identified and rewarded. But Pythia is much more
                than just a betting app. We aim to build a platform to identify and
                verify expertise fairly and provably. Why is provable expertise
                important? Today society is highly polarised. Unfortunately, many
                existing Web2 applications, far from reducing, have actually amplified 
                the division resulting in less productive discourse based on factual
                knowledge and expertise, conducive to social progress. At Pythia, we
                believe that blockchain technology can help to right these wrongs.
                While still in its infancy, Pythia will empower true experts in a
                variety of industries to bridge existing social, political, and economic divides through their expertise. At the moment, the variety of our markets is limited to crypto, but in the future, Pythia will enable market creation for non-financial (e.g., politics, sports, science etc.) markets.
